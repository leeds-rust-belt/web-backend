# web-backend

This is one of the lockdown projects I built to try and learn a bit more about Rust, in particular around using Rust for a web backend.  I started the project using the [zero2prod](https://zero2prod.com) eBook that was being being written at the time but found I had to move away from that base as I went further into the project.
